# ChunkedArray - A Chunked Array design and implementation

I created this project to at least document my thoughts on a solution for a problem at work.
I call this solution a "Chunked Array".  I obtained the name after researching possible solutions; supposedly C# has a contain that is a chunked array (I'm not sure if this is part of the language specification or just a library/add-on someone created in C#).

For now, I will lay out the high level concept and design.  And over tim e I will continue to refine it.
As for implementation, I am unsure if I will code up an actual implementation - this idea came about as a need for a problem at work, though for now we are exploring other possible ways to solve our problem(s).  I'll describe thjis more later in this document.
